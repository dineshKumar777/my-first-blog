## Operating system

I use `windows` as my work machine and mac as my personal machine.
My main requirement in tools are to cros-platform so that i can use in all my machines. Consistency is the must for me.

## Terminal

Terminal is the integral part of developer. I use `WezTerm` as my terminal. It is cross platform and has all the features i need. I use it in both windows and mac.
key benefit is its configurable via lua which is same for neovim. So i can use same config for both terminal and neovim.

## Editor

I used to primarily use `neovim` for all my development. Lately started using vscode for work related because neovim messes up the some of the workspace related configs. I use neovim for all my personal projects.
Lately i can see `vscode` appeal and even in personal projects i am starting to use it. example this blog.

## Note Taking

I tried many note taking tools but settled upon `Notion`, eventhough i dont like using closed source tool but its one of the best. Because it has web interface so that i can use it anywhere including mobile if i want. Obsidiean and other plaftorms doesnt have this key support.

## File search

This is windows only but sad part i am not able to find any alternative in other platforms. That is Void tools `everything`. It is blazing fast and i can search any file in my machine in seconds. I use it all the time.
As a software dev, we always deal with logs, dependency files, config files, etc which are mentioned in error output. I can search and open the file in seconds. I cant live without it. I hope there is some alternative in other platforms.

## Image Viewer

Another windows specific tool. MSPaint is very slow to open my image even in beefy work laptop. I use `IrfanView` which open images in an instant and we can extend the functionalities using plugins. This is another must have for me.
